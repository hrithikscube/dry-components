# dry-components

A lightweight React component library built with Tailwind CSS for styling. This library contains a collection of reusable components, making it easy to integrate into your projects.

## Features

- Built using **React** and **JSX**
- Styled with **Tailwind CSS**
- Simple and reusable component structure
- Customizable with Tailwind CSS classes

## Installation

First, install the library via npm:

```bash
npm install dry-components
```

## Usage

To use any component from the library, import it into your project like so:

```jsx
import { ComponentName } from 'dry-components';
```

## Note

This library uses Tailwind CSS for styling, so make sure you have Tailwind CSS configured in your project for the components to render properly. Without Tailwind CSS, the components will not be styled as intended.
